A project developed by four donut-loving lazy guys.
We decided to build this for HackISU Spring 2017, a code jam from Friday night until Sunday morning. A simple app that utilizes Garmin's public SDK for monkeyC and their fitness watches

## What it does
Garmin has a bunch of fitness watches. Our app will run on *most* Garmin watches. The app will be a simple watch face displaying 3 things:
1. The time
2. Some donuts
3. A distance

## What it means
1. The time is the current time: simply a watch
2. The number of donuts on screen is equivalent to the number of calories you would burn running to and back from the nearest Dunkin Donuts
3. The distance is the distance to the nearest Dunkin Donuts location

## Target Audience
Garmin caters to a very athletic crowd with their high quality fitness watches. We know that those people will not likely use or enjoy this app. Therefore, we are designing it for the more casual users of Garmin fitness watches. As such, we are developing it on the "less intense" Garmin watches (leaving out the Forerunner, etc.).
